OAuthORM

Fully beanFactory aware OAuth 1.0 implementation for ColdFusion


OAuthORM uses the ColdFusion builtin ORM for token and consumer storage and is fully BeanFactory aware (Inversion of Control).

Many thanks goes to Harry Klein for its first implementation of the protocol (http://oauth.riaforge.org), since without his inspiration the code of this project would not exist.

OAuthORM was created with ease in mind, therefore it should be much simpler in use than his father.

It's based on the Core 1.0 specification (http://oauth.net/core/1.0) which was published on 4th December 2007.
